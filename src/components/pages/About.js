        My name is Isaac Park and I graduated from the University of Washington Bothell back in 2021.
        I have a bachelor's degree in Media and Communication studies. I am currently taking a full stack
        coding course bootcamp in order to be a web developer. Going into a brand new field with no prior experience is scary, but fun.
        My goal is to have the skills to help people solve problems and build websites that accepts their acceptance criterias.
